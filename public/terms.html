            <h2>1. General Overview</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Nature of the Platform</h3>
            <p>xAIM is a blockchain-driven creative ecosystem designed to support and empower a 3D creative community. Our Services allow users to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generate AI-powered 3D mascots using 03 ChatGPT Mini and Mesh.ai API.</li>
                <li>Submit their mascots to the xAIM Mascot Gallery for public display.</li>
                <li>Participate in a game competition, where a winning mascot is selected.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Unlike traditional blockchain projects, xAIM does not require wallet connections, personal data, or financial transactions.</p>

            <h3>1.2 Scope and Applicability</h3>
            <p>These Terms govern your use of our Services, including all content, interactions, and AI-generated outputs. Your use of our Services is also subject to our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference.</p>

            <h2>2. AI-Generated Content and No Professional Advice</h2>
            <h3>2.1 AI-Powered Operations</h3>
            <p>Our Services leverage autonomous AI models (including 03 ChatGPT Mini and Mesh.ai API) to generate 3D mascots based on user prompts. AI-generated outputs are unpredictable and may not always be accurate, complete, or error-free.</p>

            <h3>2.2 No Assurance of Accuracy</h3>
            <p>All AI-generated mascots and content are for creative and entertainment purposes only. You acknowledge that AI outputs may contain inconsistencies or inaccuracies and that xAIM is not liable for any resulting issues.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The tournament will only start when all 1,024 robot slots are filled.</li>
                <li>If the maximum number of robots (1,024) is not reached, no reward will be distributed.</li>
                <li>Tournament participation does not guarantee any rewards or returns.</li>
                <li>Tournament is considered complete when all the rounds are played and there is a single winner. The single winner will be awarded the supply.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.5 Future Features and Development</h3>
